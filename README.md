Welcome to Chessington! A world of OOP board game adventures...

## Getting started

1. Make sure your machine is set up according to the instructions with

   - [bash](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/bash/)
   - [vscode](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/vscode/)
   - [git](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/git/)
   - [node & npm](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/js/installation.html)

1. Clone the repository (i.e. download it), so you have a copy on your machine.

1. Once cloned, open a terminal in the project folder, and run

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   to install dependencies.

1. To start the web server, run

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see Chessington in your browser.

> [!TIP]
>
> When you run the web server, your terminal will be stuck in a process, meaning
> you can't use it! You can always open a new one and leave the web server
> running - it is normal to have several terminals open.
>
> To stop the server, hit `ctrl + C` on your keyboard.
