# Day 3 Workshop

You may have noticed that we haven't added _any_ functionality to the Queen yet!

Your task now is to use Test Driven Development to implement the moves for the
Queen.

You should:

1. Write a new test case

1. Write a minimal amount of code to make the test pass

1. Repeat from step 1.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can "borrow" some tests from the other pieces - Queens move similarly to
> Bishops and Rooks!
